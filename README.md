# Team
A shared collection of all things computer science related. 

Feel free to create scripts, modules, etc. 
Please keep your space tidy. 

General scripts that start and end in the same file should be stored under the 'scripts' folder.
Euler solutions should go in th 'solutions' folder
Modules should be in their own folder at the same level as 'solutions', and 'scripts' so that we can call them easily in either folder. 

also included are a 'topics of discussion' folder where there is simply a .txt where any topics of discussion can be added. We will create some sort of voting program if / when necessary to allow for easy voting on Saturday discussions. 

Anything that does not fit this criteria should go in the random folder. If you feel like there is a folder you'd like to add please do not hesitate.
